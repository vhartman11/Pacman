Project Title:
Pacman

Description of Project:
There is a button that places an image of pacman at a random location.  When you hit start, pacman will start to move around the screen at a random speed and direction and will bounce off of the walls.  Create as many pacmen as you'd like.

How to Run:
- fork and clone
- download a zip file

Future Improvements:
- There are 4 picutes of pacman, so i would like the user to be able to select an image or set it to random.
